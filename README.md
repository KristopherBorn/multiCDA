*Implementation prototype of the analysis technique presented in the ICSE2018 paper "Multi-Granular Conflict and Dependency Analysis in Software Engineering based on Graph Transformation" (Lambers, Str√ºber, Taentzer, Born, Huebert).*

We use this repository to coordinate the integration of the prototype into the Henshin core.
