</center>

<blockquote>
The satisfaction of the applicability (resp. non-applicability) 
criteria described below is sufficient 
for the applicability  (resp. non-applicability) of a rule sequence to a graph. 
These criteria can be checked in a static way, 
since they are based mainly on the dependence or independence of rules. 
Moreover, the non-satisfaction of one of the criteria gives a hint to the reason for a rule
sequence to be applicable or not. 
<p>
<b>Applicability Criteria of Rule Sequences</b>
<p>
Given a sequence <i>s : r_1, r_2 ... r_n</i>&nbsp; of <i>n</i>&nbsp; rules and a graph <i>G</i>&nbsp;
on which this sequence should be applied. 
The satisfaction of (1),(2),(3) and (4a),(4b) or (4c) for each rule in <i>s</i>&nbsp; 
guarantee that <i>s</i>&nbsp; will be applicable in <i>G</i>&nbsp;.
<p>
(1) The <b><i>initialization</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: <i>r_1</i>&nbsp; is applicable on <i>G</i>&nbsp; 
via an injective match.
<p>
(2) The <b><i>no node-deleting rules</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: each rule in <i>s</i>&nbsp; 
is non-deleting on nodes, to avoid dangling edges.
In case of node-deleting, each rule has to delete all adjacent edges explicitly.<br>
(In AGG the user can turn off this rule applicability condition.)
<p>
(3) The <b><i>no impeding predecessors</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: it ensures that the applicability 
of a rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; in <i>s</i>&nbsp; is not impeded by one of the predecessor 
rules <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; of <i>r_i</i>&nbsp;.
This is the case if rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; is not in conflict with <i>r_i</i>&nbsp;.
<p>
(4a) The <b><i>pure enabling predecessor</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: it ensures that the applicability
of a rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp;,
which is not applicable on graph <i>G</i>&nbsp;, because it
is <i>purely sequential dependent</i>&nbsp; from a rule <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; occurring somewhere 
before <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; 
in the sequence <i>s</i>.&nbsp; In this case <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; triggers the applicability 
of <i>r_i</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>Purely sequential dependency</i>&nbsp; means that there exists an injective morphism from the LHS of 
rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; into the RHS of rule <i>r_j</i>.
Moreover, each NAC of <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; forbids at least one graph element of type <i>t</i>&nbsp; 
such that an element of type <i>t</i>&nbsp; is neither present in <i>G</i>&nbsp; nor
produced by any predecessor of <i>r_i</i>. 
<p>
(4b) The <b><i>partial enabling predecessor(s)</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: there exists a concurrent 
rule <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; of a not necessarily direct predecessor rule <i>r'</i>&nbsp;
and rule <i>r</i>&nbsp; such that <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; is applicable to <i>G</i>&nbsp;,
and all predecessors of <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; do not cause a conflict with <i>r_c</i>&nbsp;.
Moreover, <i>r'</i>&nbsp; is self-enabled such that its match can be forwarded to the match
of <i>r_c</i>&nbsp;.
<p>
(4c) The <b><i>direct enabling predecessor(s)</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: 
it ensures the applicability of
a rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp;, which is not applicable on graph <i>G</i>&nbsp;, 
because it is triggered  by a (resp. some) direct predecessor rule(s) 
<i>r_i-1</i>&nbsp; (<i>r_i-2</i>&nbsp; <i>r_i-3</i>&nbsp;...)  since it (resp, they)
delete(s) graph parts (edges) forbidden by <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; or 
produces graph parts needed by <i>r_i</i>&nbsp;.
This is expressed by the fact that a concurrent rule <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; of
 <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; and <i>r_i-1</i>&nbsp; (<i>r_i-2</i>&nbsp; <i>r_i-3</i>&nbsp;...) 
 exists which is applicable via an injective match 
on the start graph <i>G</i>&nbsp;. 
Moreover, <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; with &nbsp;j &lt; (i-1) &nbsp; is no impeding predecessor for <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; 
and <i>r_c</i>&nbsp; is no impeding predecessor for <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; with &nbsp;i &lt; j &lt;= n.
<p>
(4d) The <b><i>not needed</i></b>&nbsp; predecessor criterion: rule <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; itself is
applicable to graph <i>G</i>&nbsp;. 
<p>

Note that the criteria above are sufficient but not necessary for a rule sequence to be applicable on a graph.
<p> 
<b>Non-Applicability criteria of Rule Sequences</b> 
<p>
Given a sequence <i>s : r_1, r_2 ... r_n</i>&nbsp; of <i>n</i>&nbsp; rules 
and a graph <i>G</i>&nbsp; on which this sequence should not be applicable.
The satisfaction of one of the following criteria 
guarantee that this sequence will not be applicable on <i>G</i>. 
<p>
(1) The <b><i>initialization error</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: <i>r_1</i>&nbsp; is not applicable 
on graph <i>G</i>.
<p>
(2) The <b><i>no enabling predecessor</i></b>&nbsp; criterion: there exists <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; which 
is not applicable on graph <i>G</i>&nbsp; and for all rules <i>r_j</i>&nbsp; in <i>s</i>&nbsp;
with <i>1 &lt;= j &lt; i &lt;= n</i>,&nbsp; <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; is asymmetrically
sequential independent on <i>r_j</i>.
This means that <i>r_i</i>&nbsp; would need some predecessor rule producing or deleting a graph part 
to become applicable and such a rule does not exist. <br>
<br>
Additionally, our Technical Report
<b>Sufficient Criteria for Applicability and Non-Applicability of Rule Sequences</b>&nbsp;
written by L.Lambers, H.Ehrig and G.Taentzer&nbsp;
gives you a detailed explanation to this matter. You can find it
 in the example folder <b>Pizza</b>&nbsp; which is a part of the <i>AGG</i>&nbsp; 
 Examples_V164.
 <br>
<p>
<b>GUI of Applicability of Rule Sequences</b>
<p>
The GUI dialog allows to select a rule sequence in order to check its applicability 
(resp. non-applicability).
It combines two tables and some buttons.
<p>
The first table shows defined rule sequences.
<br> 
To create a new rule sequence please use the pop-up menu 
<b>GraGra -> New -> Rule Sequence</b>. A new <b>RuleSequence</b> item will appear
in GraGra tree view. You can rename it. By selecting this tree item 
a dialog will be opened which allows to define this rule sequence.
<p>
With aim to be used for applicability (resp. non-applicability) checking 
the defined rule sequence will be flattened in a plain sequence: <br>
- each subsequence (resp. each rule) 
is repeated <b><em>iterations</em></b> times;<br>
- the star  (<b>*</b>) is converted by two times.
<br>
Such flattened rule sequence is then shown in the first table of this dialog.
<br>
The second table shows the rules of the currently selected sequence.
<p>
The start graph on which a rule sequence should be applied is set automatically.
It is the current host graph of the grammar which is visible in the <b><i>AGG</i></b>&nbsp; editor.
Changing the start graph for the selected rule sequence is possible
by selecting another graph item of the current grammar 
in the <b><i>GraGras</i></b>&nbsp; tree view of the <b><i>AGG</i></b>&nbsp; application.
<p> 
In many cases though a rule sequence is given without a graph. To check a such sequence 
is possible when the button <b>Use graph</b> is not selected. 
Please note, the current implementation of this case is still in progress.
<p>
<b>Options for computing concurrent rules</b>
<p>
For the applicability criteria we need to compute for criterion 4b and 4c 
<i><b>concurrent rules</b></i>&nbsp;
which can be constructed from a sequence of single rules. 
Such a <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp; establishes in one transformation step 
the same effect as single rules would establish in consecutive transformation steps.
Thus, a <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp; summarizes in one rule which parts of graph
should be preserved, deleted and produced when applying the corresponding rule sequence
to this graph. Moreover, a summarized set of NACs on the <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp;
expressing which graph parts are forbidden.<br>
The computation of <i><b>concurrent rules</b></i>&nbsp; may be time and space expensive.
Using next three options<br>
<ul>
<li>Number of direct enabling predecessors</li>
<li>Max intersection of direct enabling predecessors</li>
<li>Incomplete recognition of potential conflict free summarized predecessors</li>
</ul>
allows to decrease the number of 
<i><b>concurrent rules</b></i>&nbsp; being built and checked and so their costs. 
If no size is set, 
the computation of <i><b>concurrent rules</b></i>&nbsp; and their checking will run as long as needed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Number of direct enabling predecessors</b> 
expresses from how many direct predecessors a rule is considered to be dependent.
Thus it gives the length of a sequence of single rules which are used to construct 
a <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp; from.
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Max intersection of direct enabling predecessors</b> means that
only the biggest overlapping of rhs and lhs rule parts is taken in account
when computing concurrent rules. 
It is assumed in this case that rules use as much as possible elements produced or
preserved by their predecessor rules.
If this option isn't selected, all possible overlapping are computed.
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Incomplete recognition of potential conflict free summarized predecessors</b>
 means that only single rules which are used to construct a <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp; from
 will be checked by <b>C</b>ritical <b>P</b>air <b>A</b>nalysis (<b>CPA</b>) for conflicts with predecessors and
 successors in the corresponding rule sequences.
 If this option isn't selected, also the <i><b>concurrent rule</b></i>&nbsp; itself will be checked 
 by CPA
 for conflicts with predecessors and successors.
<br>
Note that usage of these options may cause that the corresponding rule sequence 
doesn't satisfy anymore the applicability criteria, although it would
satisfy them if no option of these three options is used.

<p>
<b>Buttons</b>
<p>
The buttons <b>Check</b> and <b>Result</b> allow to check applicability criteria of the currently
selected rule sequence and show tables with results. 
Additionally, the button <b>Uncheck</b> for reseting results 
and the button <b>Refresh</b> to refresh the rule sequence 
after the current grammar was changed.
<p> 
There are two tables with results : <b><i>Applicability</i>&nbsp; table</b> 
and <b><i>Non-Applicability</i>&nbsp; table</b>. 
A green field of the <i>Applicability</i>&nbsp; table
(resp. a red  field of the <i>Non-Applicability</i>&nbsp; table)
shows the satisfaction of a criterion for the corresponding rule, 
an orange field corresponds to the non-satisfaction of a criterion,
a gray field denotes that it was not necessary to check a criterion 
for the corresponding rule.
<p>
The button <b>Use defined object flow</b> is enabled when an object flow is defined
for the current rule sequence. If the button is selected, the object flow is involved 
during checking applicability  (resp. non-applicability) criteria. 
It used for rule matching and for construction of concurrent rules.

<p>
The content of this dialog can be reset
by selecting another grammar in the <b><i>GraGras</i></b>&nbsp; tree view.
<p>
Rule sequences together with results of the checking applicability (resp. non-applicability) 
criteria and corresponding graph grammar can be saved (button <b>Save</b>)&nbsp; in a (.srx) file
 and loaded later again.
