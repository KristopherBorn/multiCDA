      <td> <b>The reason of failures and some tips for repairing</b> 
      <p>The most basic reason of a failing match completion is fact that
the structure of the rule's LHS is not found in the host graph. <br>
Additionally, there may be further reasons you have to check:  </p>
      <ul>
 <li> Source and/or&nbsp; target objects have wrong types.  </li>
        <li> Only injective mappings are allowed.<br>
Tip: If injective match mapping is not wanted, unset the option <i><b>injective</b></i>
in <b>Preferences / Options / Transformation</b>.   </li>
        <li>The dangling condition is not satisfied.<br>
Tip: Unset the option<i> <b>dangling</b></i> in <b>Preferences / Options
/ Transformation</b> or make sure that no edges are left <i>dangling</i>
without  source or target node by removing all objects that are to be deleted
from  the host graph.  </li>
        <li>A NAC is not satisfied.  </li>
        <li>A post application condition is not satisfied.  </li>
        <li>The type graph check (, especially the check of edge type multiplicities,
) has failed.  </li>
        <li> Invalid attribute settings  <br>
Tip: All attribute members have to be declared correctly: An attribute member
has a type, a name and perhaps a value.  Please remove empty attribute members. 
          <br>
Note: All attribute members of objects in the host graph have constants as
values.  The values of the rule object's attribute members can  be empty,
a constant, a variable, or an expression.   All variables used in a rule
have to be declared and have to be instantiated by a match. Otherwise, they
are selected as <i>In</i>  ( input parameter ) in the attribute context of
the rule to be instantiated dynamically when the transformation starts. Please
remove all unused variables in the attribute context of a rule. 
</li>
        <li>An attribute condition is not satisfied. <br>
Tip: All variables used in conditions have to be declared  in the attribute
context of the rule. </li>
