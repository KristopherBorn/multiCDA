<blockquote>
This dialog allows to select a rule priority (or some priorities) for graph consistency
 constraints of a grammar.
Generally, the consistency conditions (graph consistency constraints)
should be satisfied for each rule to be applied.
However, if certain consistency conditions should
be satisfied for certain rules only 
we can define that using rule priorities inside of this dialog. 
Consistency conditions which shoud be satisfied for all priorities 
 do not need priority setting anymore.
<p>
Selecting priority buttons of this table you can set priorities for consistency 
conditions.
